# A tuple is also an ordered collection, but its elements cannot be changed (immutable).

# Creating a tuple

a = (1, 2, 3)
b = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
c = (1, "hello", 3.14)

print(a, b, c)

# Output

(1, 2, 3) ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry') (1, 'hello', 3.14)

# In the above example, a, b, and c are tuple variables. a is (1, 2, 3), b is ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry'), and c is (1, 'hello', 3.14).
