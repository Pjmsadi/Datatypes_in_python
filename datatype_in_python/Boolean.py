# Booleans can only have two values: True or False.
# Booleans are used to compare values and to evaluate expressions.
# Boolean values are the two constant objects False and True.
# They are used to represent truth values (other values can also be considered
# false or true).

# Boolean Example

a = True
b = False
c = 5 > 3

print(a, b, c)
# Output
# True False True
# In the above example, a and b are boolean variables. a is True, b is False, and c is True.
# Note: The first letter of True and False is capitalized.
