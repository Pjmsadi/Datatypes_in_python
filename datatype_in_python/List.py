# A list is an ordered collection that can hold different data types.

# Creating a list

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
c = [1, "hello", 3.14]

print(a, b, c)

# Output

[1, 2, 3] ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'] [1, 'hello', 3.14]
# In the above example, a, b, and c are list variables. a is [1, 2, 3], b is ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'], and c is [1, 'hello', 3.14].
# Accessing elements in a list
# You can access elements in a list by using their index. The index starts from 0.
